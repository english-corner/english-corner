      Suggestions for a marvelous QHD Sailing English Club

      We have an exciting club that motivates people to study English.   As we grow we want to preserve and improve our club.   Some guidelines and goals are needed to accomplish this.  
      
      1.  Club Motto
       “Welcome every friend who loves and tries the best to learn English.” 
          ( Rose receives credit for this great quote.)
      
      2.  Goals for Members
       Members strive to create an atmosphere that promotes the success of the club.
        We treat others as valued friends.
        We use the club to improve our spoken English skills.
        We encourage everyone who is trying to improve.  
         We understand that we all make mistakes.
         We realize we are all at different skill levels in spoken English.
         We kindly coach each other.
         We recognize good efforts and improvements.
        We cooperate with the decisions of the club as much as we are able.
        We volunteer to moderate meetings and/or assist with other activities.
        
      3.  Meeting Format
       Members take turns being a moderator.
       The moderator will choose a subject for discussion.
       The moderator is responsible for guiding the discussion.
       The meeting format will attempt to include features that are useful
            for different speaking skill levels such as translating English sometimes.
       Everyone attending a meeting will be given equal opportunity to speak English.
       
      4.   WeChat
       We use WeChat to promote the goals of the club, such as communicating with friends
           Club news and supporting those learning English.   
       The WeChat site will have an owner who supervises the activities on WeChat.
       WeChat members will follow government regulations.
       Anonymous posts, commercial posts, personal grievance posts, etc. cannot be allowed.
       Any member can invite a friend who supports the goals of this club.
       Membership in our WeChat group is temporary.  
       Every December each WeChat member needs to renew his/her membership.

      5.  Meeting Venue
       We will seek a meeting place that encourages discussion.
       Members will financially support such a meeting place.
      
      6.  Oversight committee
       Core members are the oversight committee.   Core members are????
       The oversight committee will establish methods and regulations that support our goals.
       The oversight committee will choose a manager or managers who take responsibility
           for satisfying the goals of the club.
       The oversight committee will meet regularly.
          
      7.  Miscellaneous 
       The club will sponsor weekly meetings when possible.
       Members are people who attend meetings or participate in our WeChat group.
       A member may freely leave the club at any time.
       A member who shows disrespect for the goals of the club will be admonished.   
           If the disrespectful behavior continues that member will be asked to leave.
